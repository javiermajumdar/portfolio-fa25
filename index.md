My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Mechanical engineering student at Cornell University with hands-on experience in simulation (FEA/FEM), CAD modeling, and cross-disciplinary R&D at the intersection of mechanics and AI. Developed wearable-rate responsive materials, optimized automation pipelines using LLMs, and contributed to biomedical hardware research. Strong background in prototyping, data analysis, and engineering problem-solving for defense and medical tech applications.
