For this project, our team dissected and analyzed the fluid-mechanical operation of a Dirt Devil vacuum cleaner,focusing on its internal assembly, pressure generation, and relevant nondimensional flow parameters. 

Here is the link to the video of our Fluid Mechanical Dissection:

My contribution: I dissected the vacuum cleaner, took geometric measurements for the analysis, developed the relevant fluid mechanics equations, completed the calculations, and verified that the results were reasonable for the system.
